# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe

## Installation

Play the game [here][1]!

### Build

This project is written in [TypeScript][2] with no external packages.

```sh
tsc
```

Alternatively, use the Makefile commands if you have the Make tool.

## Instructions

Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe is fairly intuitive and the [rules][3] on Wikipedia are
**much** more confusing than necessary. I recommend learning by playing. In a
nutshell, there is 1 big grid that is controlled by 9 smaller grids. You win by
winning on the big grid.

### Playing against AI

You can configure players via `Config > Update Player X/O > New Game`.

You can also have 2 AIs battle it out!
